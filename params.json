  "body": "Moneta is a fault-tolerant, distributed task manager. It is intended to be a replacement for the traditional UNIX cron systems, allowing a scheduled execution of tasks on one or several nodes of a cluster.\r\n\r\nIt requires a Zookeeper cluster for configuration storage and cluster synchronization. Task execution reports can be stored in ElasticSearch, in a way that is easily exploitable using Kibana.",
